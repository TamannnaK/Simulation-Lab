This assignment demonstrates how to generate random numerical data using Python and visualize it using the matplotlib library. Two random vectors are created and plotted on the same graph to compare their behavior.

Objectives:

Generate two vectors containing random floating-point numbers

Plot both vectors on a single graph

Properly label axes and add a meaningful title
